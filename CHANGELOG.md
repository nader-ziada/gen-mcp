## [Unreleased] – PR #162

### Added
- Introduced the NETEDGE MCP manifest with the ingress and DNS diagnostic toolset used for evaluation (`examples/netedge-tools/mcpfile.yaml`). (#162)
- Added supporting documentation and agent transcripts for the scenarios, including a pointer to the canonical evaluation notes in `github.com/genmcp/gevals` (`examples/netedge-tools/docs`). (#162)
- Documented the NETEDGE Phase-0 gen-mcp tooling notes (`examples/netedge-tools/docs/NETEDGE-GEN-MCP-NOTES.md`). (#162)
- Added a focused unit test for the Prometheus query tool to ensure `.svc` URLs fall back to the routed endpoint (`test/query_prometheus_tool_test.go`). (#162)
- Updated `.gitignore` to drop generated evaluation artifacts from version control. (#162)

## [Unreleased] – PR #151

### Added
- Binary download and caching system for `genmcp build` command - server binaries are now downloaded from GitHub releases instead of being embedded in the CLI (#151)
- Sigstore-based cryptographic verification of downloaded binaries for security (built into CLI, no external dependencies) (#151)
- Version-platform cache management to store and reuse downloaded binaries across builds (#151)
- `--server-version` flag to specify which server binary version to download (#151)
- Automatic "latest" resolution for development builds - dev CLI versions automatically download the latest stable server binaries (#151)
- Automatic fallback to cached version if download fails - works offline with previously cached binaries (#151)
- Automatic cache cleanup - keeps last 3 versions per platform to prevent unbounded cache growth (#151)

### Changed
- `genmcp build` now downloads server binaries from GitHub releases, significantly reducing CLI binary size (#151)
- Server binaries are cached locally (in user cache directory) and reused across builds (#151)

### Removed
- Embedded server binaries from CLI - binaries are now downloaded on-demand, reducing the CLI size from ~100MB to ~78MB (#151)
- `--use-embedded-binaries` flag (no longer needed as embedded binaries have been removed) (#151)

## [v0.1.1]

### Added
- `invocationBases` schema field and `extends` invocation type for defining reusable base configurations that can be extended by multiple invocations, enabling configuration composition and reducing duplication across tools, prompts, and resources (backward compatible with existing mcpfiles) (#203)
- HTTP header support for `http` invocations, allowing static and templated headers with support for input parameters, incoming request headers (streamablehttp only), and environment variables (#204)
- Request header support for `cli` invocations, allowing input parameters to reference incoming request headers (streamablehttp only) (#205)

### Changed
- Refactored invocation configuration parsing to use generic factory pattern instead of custom parsers per type (#203)
- `genmcp build` now defaults to building multi-arch images (linux/amd64 and linux/arm64), with the `--platform` flag allowing single-platform builds for faster iteration (#196)

### Removed
- Custom invocation config parsers for CLI and HTTP types in favor of unified factory approach (#203)

## [v0.1.0]

### Added
- Runtime environment variable overrides in mcpfile (#177)
- Tool annotations support (destructiveHint, idempotentHint, openWorldHint) to indicate tool behavior to clients (#180)
- Server instructions support to provide context to LLMs (#173)
- Comprehensive logging system with invocation and server logs (#168)
- JSON schema validation for mcpfile (#155)
- Support for MCP spec `resource` and `resourceTemplate` primitives (#157)
- Support for MCP spec `Prompts` (#138)
- `genmcp build` command to create container images from mcpfiles (#126)
- AI-based converter for CLI tools (#67)
- Structured output from HTTP JSON responses (#107)
- `genmcp version` command (#105)
- gRPC integration demo showcasing GenMCP with gRPC services (#153)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Simplified mcpfile format by embedding server fields directly, migrated format version to v0.1.0 (#137)
- GenMCP now uses the official [Model Context Protocol Go SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk) (#90)
- Bumped MCP Go-SDK to v1.0.0 release (#134)
- StreamableHttp servers are now configurable as stateless or stateful (default: stateless) (#100)
- Migrated from ghodss/yaml to sigs.k8s.io/yaml (#89)

### Deprecated

### Removed
- Vendor directory to reduce PR noise (#154)

### Fixed
- Parsing now returns proper error on invalid mcpfile version (#171)
- OpenAPI 2.0 body parameter handling now correctly aligns with spec (#150)
- Tool input schemas with empty properties now correctly serialize to `{}` (#112)
- OAuth example ports corrected to avoid conflicts (#101)
- Individual tool errors in OpenAPI conversion no longer block entire mcpfile creation (#97)
- Release workflows now target correct branches (#86)
- Nightly release job now manages only a single 'nightly' tag (#83)
